# SkiRaf
An ETL testing framework written in python and specialized for pygrametl. Created as a part of a bachelor project for the study group d608f16 at Aalborg University

d608f16 is composed of Alexander Brandborg, Arash Michael Sami Kjær, Mathias Claus Jensen and Mikael Vind Mikkelsen.

SkiRaf is a testing framework for ETLs that provide a series of tools. Its main functionality is that it allows users to make assertions regarding a data warehouse populated by an ETL. This is done through the Predicates found in SkiRaf/predicates/. Furthermore SkiRaf also provides a way for users of pygrametl to dynamically swap out hardcoded data sources and data warehouses from their ETL programs. This allows for users to provide test data sources and data warehouses for their tests more easily. This is done with the DWPopulator found in SkiRaf/dwpopulator/
